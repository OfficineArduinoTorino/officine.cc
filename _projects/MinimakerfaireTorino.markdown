Maker Faires are days dedicated to all forms of creativity and introspection, an event where anyone can show his creativity and share what he know. The purpose of Maker Faire is to entertain, inform, and give strength to the maker community. Age does not matter, training does not even matter: it only has the guts and the desire to do it.
Since 2013 Officine Innesto and Toolbox Coworking are organizing together this incredible moment of creativity.
