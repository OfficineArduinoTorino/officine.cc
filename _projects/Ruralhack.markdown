[RuralHack](http://www.ruralhack.org/) is a research / action project that investigates both the cultural and technological aspects of the relationship between Open Hardware and Agriculture.

The aim is to facilitate access to state-of-the-art technology and cost-effective precursor agriculture to enable farmers to create infrastructures and products.

Open Hardware, along with open data, is designed to generate new consumer logic related to ethical and shared principles, abandoning resource exploitation and the patented patent logic.

Rural hack is organizing workshops around Italy and Europe in collaboration with Officine Innesto and Rural hub
