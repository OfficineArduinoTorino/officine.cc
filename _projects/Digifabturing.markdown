Digifacturing is the research project on new production processes, digital crafts, 3D printing and robotics.
Digifacturing rises from a collaboration between several partners: Fablab Torino, Officine Arduino with COMAU and Toolbox Coworking as well as Co-de-iT; all together we will focus on new landscapes of experimentation. Digital fabrication + robotic automation applied in the field of architecture, interaction design and art will be just few of the several realities we wish to experiment; every step will be conceived in order to understand how can, so many different fields of applications, actually co-exhist and evolve, through a process of mutual contamination. Here we wish to discover new landscapes of experimentation offering a different perspective about the world of design for research.
The multidisciplinary team that will actually work with the robot will be composed by several professionals: some with a “maker” background, others more technical from the fields of electronics and computational design. Now a lot of work is waiting for us to start; several are the experiments to test and projects to develop and we cannot see the time projects will be finally real.
