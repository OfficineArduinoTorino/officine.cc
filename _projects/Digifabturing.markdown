[Digifacturing](http://digifabturing.tumblr.com/) is the research project on new production processes, digital crafts, 3D printing and robotics.
Digifacturing rises from a collaboration between several partners: [Fablab Torino](http://fablabtorino.org/), Officine Innesto with [COMAU](http://www.comau.com/EN) and [Toolbox Coworking](www.toolboxoffice.it/en/) as well as [Co-de-iT](http://www.co-de-it.com/wordpress/); all together we will focus on new landscapes of experimentation. Digital fabrication + robotic automation applied in the field of architecture, interaction design and art will be just few of the several realities we wish to experiment; every step will be conceived in order to understand how could, so many different fields of applications, actually co-exhist and evolve, through a process of mutual contamination. Here we wish to discover new landscapes of experimentation offering a different perspective about the world of design for research.
The multidisciplinary team that will actually work with the robot will be composed by several professionals: some with a “maker” background, others more technical from the fields of electronics and computational design. Now a lot of work is waiting for us to start; several are the experiments to test and projects to develop and we cannot see the time projects will be finally real.
