Fablab Torino is the first Italian Fablab. Born in 2012 together with the experience of Officine Arduino (now Officine Innesto).
The experience of Fablab Turin comes from different forces and needs with a single goal: bringing Digital Fabrication and Open Source culture to a physical site where machines, ideas, people and new approaches can be blended freely.
Fablab often works as a hub of Skills, where people who attend it find among other users the know-how they need to realize their projects.
Today, Fablab Torino continues to use Officine Innesto's support.
The founding members of FabLab Torino are:
Massimo Banzi; Riccardo Luna; Paola Zini; Alex Ferraris; Andrea Graziano; Cesare Griffa; Franco Magni; Giorgio Olivero; Andrea Patrucco; Lorenzo Romagnoli; Gualtiero Tumolo; David Mushroom; Enrico Bassi.
