Fablab for Kids is a collection of workshops to bring children closer to the fablab technologies, to the culture of creators and to digital DIY, and to promote an active and creative attitude towards science and technology.
First, you learn by doing. At Fablab for Kids labs, learning is not a passive act, but the fruit of a shared journey of exploration, experimentation, reflection, during which you also learn to face the fear of failure, refine your knowledge sharing skills.  Knowing how to do it, it promotes a creative and autonomous approach to learning.

Second, not procedures but goals. At Fablab for Kids labs you reach the goal by following a path, not the train rails: you follow steps, principles, there are no procedures because the procedures are boring and they are fine for themselves. What's the point of following the instructions? Better - a lot better - have the Emerald City on the horizon and a beautiful plain in front with newly traced paths.

Third, falling you learn.  A mistake is good because it means that you've taken a new road, you figured where you could bring it and you tried to walk it. This does not mean trying to make the mistake at all costs, but if it does, we certainly will not face the other side.

Fourth, the formulas only at the end. At the Fablab for Kids labs once you've reached the goal then you can understand the formula, the abstract principle, in fact, will help you to simplify and structure what you learned.
